      <title>Tumor radiogenomics with Bayesian layered variable selection</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose a statistical framework to integrate radiological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and genomic data to identify the underlying radiogenomic associations in lower grade gliomas (LGG). We devise a novel imaging phenotype by dividing the tumor region into concentric spherical layers that mimics the tumor evolution process. MRI data within each layer is represented by voxel&amp;ndash;intensity-based probability density functions which capture the complete information about tumor heterogeneity. Under a Riemannian-geometric framework these densities are mapped to a vector of principal component scores which act as imaging phenotypes. Subsequently, we build Bayesian variable selection models for each layer with the imaging phenotypes as the response and the genomic markers as predictors. Our novel hierarchical prior formulation incorporates the interior-to-exterior structure of the layers, and the correlation between the genomic markers. We employ a computationally-efficient Expectation&amp;ndash;Maximization-based strategy for estimation. Simulation studies demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to other approaches. With a focus on the cancer driver genes in LGG, we discuss some biologically relevant findings. Genes implicated with survival and oncogenesis are identified as being associated with the spherical layers, which could potentially serve as early-stage diagnostic markers for disease monitoring, prior to routine invasive approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatial Tweedie exponential dispersion models: An application to insurance rate-making</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scandinavian Actuarial Journal&lt;/em&gt; (2021).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper we propose a statistical modeling framework that contributes to advancing methods for modeling insurance policy premium in the actuarial literature. Specification of separate frequency and severity models, accounting for territorial risk and performing accurate inference are some of the challenges actuaries face while modeling policy premium. We focus on building a methodology that builds parsimonious and interpretable models for modeling policy premium. Policy premiums are characterized to follow a semi-continuous probability distribution, featuring a non-zero probability mass at zero along with a positive continuous support. Interpretability is a concern when quantifying risks that policy premium face from spatial variation. Risk conferred from spatial sources is often treated as an unobserved. Commonly used strategies in the literature are known to successfully quantify the variation, but do not necessarily produce interpretable estimates. Furthermore, resorting to two-part frequency-severity models leaves the actuary indecisive about the specification of covariates and spatial effects. The proposed methods in the paper considers a more parsimonious approach by resorting to zero-adjusted models for policy premium, that models both the mean policy-premium and the associated dispersion around the mean. Quantification of variation from spatial sources is proposed for the mean model. Allowing for a non-constant dispersion across observations results in a better estimate of the underlying variability, producing superior estimates for coefficients. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the framework developed, that allows for joint estimation of effect of policy or individual characteristics on both the mean policy premium and dispersion, while quantifying spatial variability in the mean model. The developed methods are applied to a database featuring policy premiums arising from the collision coverage in insurance policies for motor vehicles within the state of Connecticut, USA for the year 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrative Bayesian models using post-selective inference: a case study in radiogenomics</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying direct links between gene pathways and clinical endpoints for highly fatal diseases such as cancer is a formidable task. Integrative analyses play a crucial role in modeling these links by relying upon associations between a wealth of intermediary variables and genomic measurements. Motivated to harness phenotypic information about tumors towards a molecular characterization of low-grade gliomas, we develop a data driven Bayesian framework to define sharp models, and calibrate accurately and efficiently uncertainties associated with the promising biological findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bayesian methods we propose in the article (i) are amenable to a flexible class of adaptive models, determined via a complex interplay between signals sifted from variable selection algorithms and domain specific knowledge; (ii) have the advantage of computationally efficient high dimensional inference due to a focus on sharp models with fewer parameters, when compared to their non-adaptive counterparts; (iii) exhibit a significantly better reconciliation between model adaptivity and inferential power than state-of-art approaches, when constrained by the curse of dimensionality. Our main workforce involves a carefully constructed conditional likelihood and utilizes a reparameterization map to obtain compact formulae for a selection-corrected posterior. Deploying our methods to investigate radiogenomic characteristics for diffuse low-grade gliomas, we successfully uncover associations between several biologically important gene pathways and patient survival times.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatial risk estimation in Tweedie compound Poisson double generalized linear models</title>
      <link>https://shariq-mohammed.github.io/publication/halder2019spatial/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tweedie exponential dispersion family constitutes a fairly rich sub-class of the celebrated exponential family. In particular, a member, compound Poisson gamma (CP-g) model has seen extensive use over the past decade for modeling mixed response featuring exact zeros with a continuous response from a gamma distribution. This paper proposes a framework to perform residual analysis on CP-g double generalized linear models for spatial uncertainty quantification. Approximations are introduced to proposed framework making the procedure scalable, without compromise in accuracy of estimation and model complexity; accompanied by sensitivity analysis to model mis-specification. Proposed framework is applied to modeling spatial uncertainty in insurance loss costs arising from automobile collision coverage. Scalability is demonstrated by choosing sizable spatial reference domains comprised of groups of states within the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;
