      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying direct links between gene pathways and clinical endpoints for highly fatal diseases such as cancer is a formidable task. Integrative analyses play a crucial role in modeling these links by relying upon associations between a wealth of intermediary variables and genomic measurements. Motivated to harness phenotypic information about tumors towards a molecular characterization of low-grade gliomas, we develop a data driven Bayesian framework to define sharp models, and calibrate accurately and efficiently uncertainties associated with the promising biological findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bayesian methods we propose in the article (i) are amenable to a flexible class of adaptive models, determined via a complex interplay between signals sifted from variable selection algorithms and domain specific knowledge; (ii) have the advantage of computationally efficient high dimensional inference due to a focus on sharp models with fewer parameters, when compared to their non-adaptive counterparts; (iii) exhibit a significantly better reconciliation between model adaptivity and inferential power than state-of-art approaches, when constrained by the curse of dimensionality. Our main workforce involves a carefully constructed conditional likelihood and utilizes a reparameterization map to obtain compact formulae for a selection-corrected posterior. Deploying our methods to investigate radiogenomic characteristics for diffuse low-grade gliomas, we successfully uncover associations between several biologically important gene pathways and patient survival times.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatial risk estimation in Tweedie compound Poisson double generalized linear models</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tweedie exponential dispersion family constitutes a fairly rich sub-class of the celebrated exponential family. In particular, a member, compound Poisson gamma (CP-g) model has seen extensive use over the past decade for modeling mixed response featuring exact zeros with a continuous response from a gamma distribution. This paper proposes a framework to perform residual analysis on CP-g double generalized linear models for spatial uncertainty quantification. Approximations are introduced to proposed framework making the procedure scalable, without compromise in accuracy of estimation and model complexity; accompanied by sensitivity analysis to model mis-specification. Proposed framework is applied to modeling spatial uncertainty in insurance loss costs arising from automobile collision coverage. Scalability is demonstrated by choosing sizable spatial reference domains comprised of groups of states within the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatial Tweedie exponential dispersion models</title>
      <link>https://shariq-mohammed.github.io/publication/halder2020spatial/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a general modeling framework that allows for uncertainty quantification at the individual covariate level and spatial referencing, operating withing a double generalized linear model (DGLM). DGLMs provide a general modeling framework allowing dispersion to depend in a link-linear fashion on chosen covariates. We focus on working with Tweedie exponential dispersion models while considering DGLMs, the reason being their recent wide-spread use for modeling mixed response types. Adopting a regularization based approach, we suggest a class of flexible convex penalties derived from an un-directed graph that facilitates estimation of the unobserved spatial effect. Developments are concisely showcased by proposing a co-ordinate descent algorithm that jointly explains variation from covariates in mean and dispersion through estimation of respective model coefficients while estimating the unobserved spatial effect. Simulations performed show that proposed approach is superior to competitors like the ridge and un-penalized versions. Finally, a real data application is considered while modeling insurance losses arising from automobile collisions in the state of Connecticut, USA for the year 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
