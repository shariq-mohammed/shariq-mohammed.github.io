&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only 536 cases and 11 fatalities, India took the historic decision of a 21-day national lockdown on March 25. The lockdown was first extended to May 3 soon after the analysis of this paper was completed, and then to May 18 while this paper was being revised. In this paper, we use a Bayesian extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (eSIR) model designed for intervention forecasting to study the short- and long-term impact of an initial 21-day lockdown on the total number of COVID-19 infections in India compared to other less severe non-pharmaceutical interventions. We compare effects of hypothetical durations of lockdown on reducing the number of active and new infections. We find that the lockdown, if implemented correctly, can reduce the total number of cases in the short term, and buy India invaluable time to prepare its healthcare and disease-monitoring system. Our analysis shows we need to have some measures of suppression in place after the lockdown for increased benefit (as measured by reduction in the number of cases). A longer lockdown between 42-56 days is preferable to substantially “flatten the curve” when compared to 21-28 days of lockdown. Our models focus solely on projecting the number of COVID-19 infections and thus, inform policymakers about one aspect of this multi-faceted decision-making problem. We conclude with a discussion on the pivotal role of increased testing, reliable and transparent data, proper uncertainty quantification, accurate interpretation of forecasting models, reproducible data science methods and tools that can enable data-driven policymaking during a pandemic.

      <title>Spatial risk estimation in Tweedie compound Poisson double generalized linear models</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tweedie exponential dispersion family constitutes a fairly rich sub-class of the celebrated exponential family. In particular, a member, compound Poisson gamma (CP-g) model has seen extensive use over the past decade for modeling mixed response featuring exact zeros with a continuous response from a gamma distribution. This paper proposes a framework to perform residual analysis on CP-g double generalized linear models for spatial uncertainty quantification. Approximations are introduced to proposed framework making the procedure scalable, without compromise in accuracy of estimation and model complexity; accompanied by sensitivity analysis to model mis-specification. Proposed framework is applied to modeling spatial uncertainty in insurance loss costs arising from automobile collision coverage. Scalability is demonstrated by choosing sizable spatial reference domains comprised of groups of states within the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatial Tweedie exponential dispersion models</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a general modeling framework that allows for uncertainty quantification at the individual covariate level and spatial referencing, operating withing a double generalized linear model (DGLM). DGLMs provide a general modeling framework allowing dispersion to depend in a link-linear fashion on chosen covariates. We focus on working with Tweedie exponential dispersion models while considering DGLMs, the reason being their recent wide-spread use for modeling mixed response types. Adopting a regularization based approach, we suggest a class of flexible convex penalties derived from an un-directed graph that facilitates estimation of the unobserved spatial effect. Developments are concisely showcased by proposing a co-ordinate descent algorithm that jointly explains variation from covariates in mean and dispersion through estimation of respective model coefficients while estimating the unobserved spatial effect. Simulations performed show that proposed approach is superior to competitors like the ridge and un-penalized versions. Finally, a real data application is considered while modeling insurance losses arising from automobile collisions in the state of Connecticut, USA for the year 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
