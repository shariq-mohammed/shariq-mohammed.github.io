      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt; (Supplement; Conference Proceedings) (2025).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;: The digital clock drawing test (dCDT) is a cognitive screening tool employing a digital pen to capture high-resolution pen movements. Traditional dCDT approaches to predict cognitive outcomes often rely on many summary features (e.g. time to completion, mean pressure, clock face area, etc.) which involve subjective decisions such as feature selection and imputation of missing data. To address these limitations, we introduce novel dCDT features, expressed as mathematical functions. These functional features include the G-function (measuring spatial proximity of points), pressure density function (measuring variability in pressure exerted on the paper), and radius function (measuring circularity of the clock face). We compare the performance of these functional features to 45 commonly used summary features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;: We included dCDTs from 3,415 stroke-free participants from the Framingham Heart Study with at least one command or copy task. Random forest models with five-fold cross-validation were trained to distinguish participants with MCI or dementia from cognitively intact participants. Predictors included combinations of demographics, time-based features, summary features, and functional features. Functional features underwent dimension reduction using functional principal components analysis. Area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity assessed model performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;: Average age was 63.6 years (SD: 13.9), with 1,546 (45%) males, 785 (23%) having at least one APOE-e4 allele, and 1,957 (57%) having a college education. At the time of the dCDT, 122 (4%) had mild cognitive impairment and 74 (2%) had dementia. When combined with demographics and time-based features, functional features from command and copy tests related to spatial proximity (AUC: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.88-0.92) and circularity (AUC: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.89-0.93) were as predictive as summary features (AUC: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.88-0.92). Similar results were found when analyzing command and copy features separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions&lt;/em&gt;: Functional features of the dCDT offer several advantages such as robustness to missing data, decreased subjectivity in feature selection, and avoidance of reducing complex information into summary statistics. In addition, there is potential to make inferences about cognition based on the shape and behavior of the functions. Further research is required to better understand what these functional features reveal about cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lifelong trends in vascular risk factors and cerebral small vessel disease</title>
      <link>https://shariq-mohammed.github.io/publication/pinheiro2025lifelong/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Heart Association International Stroke Conference (ISC) 2025 Proceedings&lt;/em&gt; (2025).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background &amp;amp; Hypothesis.&lt;/strong&gt; Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) contributes to stroke and dementia risk and may evolve over decades. The study posited that people follow distinct lifetime trajectories of modifiable vascular risk factors (VRFs) and that these VRF patterns are associated with CSVD burden later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods.&lt;/strong&gt; Using Framingham Heart Study participants with at least six lifetime VRF assessments and brain MRI markers of CSVD, the team derived a multi‑marker CSVD score (range 0–5; components included covert infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, extensive white‑matter hyperintensities, cortical superficial siderosis, and high perivascular space burden) and grouped it as 0, 1, or ≥2. Functional data clustering identified lifetime trajectories for individual VRFs; multivariable ordinal logistic regression then related trajectory membership to CSVD burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results.&lt;/strong&gt; Among 7,961 individuals with longitudinal VRF data (baseline mean age ≈40 years; ~45% men), three trajectory clusters typically emerged per VRF: persistently adverse, persistently optimal, and intermediate patterns. In the MRI subset (n = 1,625; mean age ≈73 years; ~45% men), CSVD scores were 0 in ~47%, 1 in ~31%, and ≥2 in ~22%. After adjustment (age, sex, cohort), membership in higher‑risk lifetime trajectories for systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure (p &amp;lt; 0.01), cigarettes per day (p = 0.01), and body‑mass index (p &amp;lt; 0.05) was associated with higher CSVD burden; for example, compared with long‑term optimal systolic blood pressure, persistently elevated or intermediate trajectories showed higher odds of greater CSVD scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions.&lt;/strong&gt; Distinct lifetime patterns of modifiable VRFs track with later‑life CSVD burden. Preventive strategies should account for &lt;strong&gt;trajectories&lt;/strong&gt;—not just single time‑point measures—when identifying individuals at elevated risk for CSVD and its consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Low‑parameter supervised learning models can discriminate pseudoprogression and true progression in non‑perfusion‑based MRI</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discrimination of pseudoprogression and true progression is challenging in malignant gliomas. We investigate low‑parametric supervised learning (geographically weighted regression; GWR) on widely available MRI modalities—including ADC—to distinguish pseudoprogression from true progression. Applying GWR to modality pairs is suitable for small samples and novel in this setting. Modality pairs involving ADC and those regressing post‑contrast T1 onto T2 showed promise. Results suggest the predictive benefit of ADC and motivate further study of relationships between post‑contrast T1 and T2.  &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatial risk estimation in Tweedie compound Poisson double generalized linear models</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International E-Conference on Mathematical and Statistical Sciences: A Selçuk Meeting (ICOMSS 2022) Proceedings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tweedie exponential dispersion family constitutes a fairly rich sub-class of the celebrated exponential family. In particular, a member, compound Poisson gamma (CP-g) model has seen extensive use over the past decade for modeling mixed response featuring exact zeros with a continuous response from a gamma distribution. This paper proposes a framework to perform residual analysis on CP-g double generalized linear models for spatial uncertainty quantification. Approximations are introduced to proposed framework making the procedure scalable, without compromise in accuracy of estimation and model complexity; accompanied by sensitivity analysis to model mis-specification. Proposed framework is applied to modeling spatial uncertainty in insurance loss costs arising from automobile collision coverage. Scalability is demonstrated by choosing sizable spatial reference domains comprised of groups of states within the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A dynamical systems approach to systemic risk in a financial network</title>
      <link>https://shariq-mohammed.github.io/publication/bhat2016dynamical/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indian Control Conference (ICC 2016) Proceedings&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insolvency of a financial entity such as a bank can trigger a sequence of defaults in a network of financial entities interconnected through mutual financial obligations, thus posing a systemic risk to all the financial entities that make up the network. This paper studies the well-known Eisenberg–Noe model for systemic risk from a dynamical systems perspective. In particular, we model the sequence of defaults in the form of a dynamical system, and provide results on its stability and asymptotic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
