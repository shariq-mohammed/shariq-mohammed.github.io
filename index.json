Since the disease spreads from carriers to susceptible individuals via some form of contact, it inherently relies upon a network of individuals for its growth, with edges established via direct interaction, such as shared physical proximity. Using spatial and individual-level COVID-19 data from the early days (January 30 to April 15, 2020) of the pandemic in India, and under a network-based SIR model framework, we performed state-specific forecasting under multiple scenarios characterized by the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across 34 Indian states and union territories.

It is identified by radiologists through visual inspection of pre-operative MRI scans, and has been shown to identify IDH-mutant 1p/19q non-codeleted gliomas with high positive predictive value. We have developed an approach to quantify the T2-FLAIR mismatch signature, and use it to predict molecular status of lower-grade gliomas (LGG).\nMaterials and Methods. We used multi-parametric MRI scans and segmentation labels of 108 pre-operative LGG tumors from The Cancer Imaging Archive. Clinical information and T2-FLAIR mismatch sign labels were obtained from supplementary material of relevant publications. We adopted an objective analytical approach to estimate this sign through a geographically weighted regression (GWR), and use the residuals for each case to construct a probability density function (serving as residual signature). These functions are then analyzed using an appropriate statistical framework.\nResults. We observe statistically significant (p-value = 0.05) differences between the averages of residual signatures for IDH-mutated 1p/19q non-codeleted class of tumors versus other categories. Our classifier predicts these cases with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98, high specificity and sensitivity. It also predicts T2-FLAIR mismatch sign within these cases with an AUC of 0.93.\nConclusions. Based on this retrospective study, we show that GWR-based residual signatures are highly informative of T2-FLAIR mismatch sign, and can identify IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion status with high predictive power.

Specification of separate frequency and severity models, accounting for territorial risk and performing accurate inference are some of the challenges actuaries face while modeling policy premium. We focus on building a methodology that builds parsimonious and interpretable models for modeling policy premium. Policy premiums are characterized to follow a semi-continuous probability distribution, featuring a non-zero probability mass at zero along with a positive continuous support. Interpretability is a concern when quantifying risks that policy premium face from spatial variation. Risk conferred from spatial sources is often treated as an unobserved. Commonly used strategies in the literature are known to successfully quantify the variation, but do not necessarily produce interpretable estimates. Furthermore, resorting to two-part frequency-severity models leaves the actuary indecisive about the specification of covariates and spatial effects. The proposed methods in the paper considers a more parsimonious approach by resorting to zero-adjusted models for policy premium, that models both the mean policy-premium and the associated dispersion around the mean. Quantification of variation from spatial sources is proposed for the mean model. Allowing for a non-constant dispersion across observations results in a better estimate of the underlying variability, producing superior estimates for coefficients. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the framework developed, that allows for joint estimation of effect of policy or individual characteristics on both the mean policy premium and dispersion, while quantifying spatial variability in the mean model.

We specifically deal with multi-subject electroencephalography (EEG) data with a binary response distinguishing between alcoholic and control groups. The covariates are matrix-variate with measurements taken for each subject at different locations across multiple time points. EEG data has a complex structure with both spatial and temporal attributes to it. We use a divide-and-conquer strategy to build multiple local models, that is, one model at each time point separately. We employ Bayesian variable selection approaches using a structured continuous spike-and-slab prior to identify the locations which respond to a certain stimulus. We incorporate the spatio-temporal structure through a Kronecker product of the spatial and temporal correlation matrices. We develop a highly scalable estimation algorithm using likelihood approximation to deal with large number of parameters in the model.

In this study, we proposed to use a multiparametric MRI data as a sequence input for the convolutional neural network with the recurrent neural network based deep learning structure to discriminate between pseudoprogression and true tumor progression. In this study, 43 biopsy-proven patient data identified as diffuse infiltrating glioma patients whose disease progressed/recurred were used. The dataset consists of five original MRI sequences; pre-contrast T1-weighted, post-contrast T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, and ADC images as well as two engineered sequences; T1post – T1pre and T2 – FLAIR. Next, we used three CNN-LSTM models with a different set of sequences as input sequences to pass through CNN-LSTM layers. We performed 3-fold cross-validation in the training dataset and generated the boxplot, accuracy, and ROC curve, AUC from each trained model with the test dataset to evaluate models. The mean accuracy for VGG16 models ranged from 0.44 to 0.60 and the mean AUC ranged from 0.47 to 0.59. For CNN-LSTM model, the mean accuracy ranged from 0.62 to 0.75 and the mean AUC ranged from 0.64 to 0.81. The performance of the proposed CNN-LSTM with multiparametric sequence data was found to outperform the popular convolutional CNN with a single MRI sequence. In conclusion, incorporating all available MRI sequences into a sequence input for a CNN-LSTM model improved diagnostic performance for discriminating between pseudoprogression and true tumor progression.\n","date":1604016000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604016000,"objectID":"dc7b22680af2c5096126e50697c51d2c","permalink":"https://shariq-mohammed.github.io/publication/lee2020discriminating/","publishdate":"2020-10-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lee2020discriminating/","section":"publication","summary":"Scientific Reports (2020).\nAbstract: Differentiating pseudoprogression from true tumor progression has become a significant challenge in follow-up of diffuse infiltrating gliomas, particularly high grade, which leads to a potential treatment delay for patients with early glioma recurrence.

Previous studies have taken advantage of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and shown that the thickness of individual retinal layers are affected in patients with DR. However, most studies analyzed the thickness by calculating summary statistics from retinal thickness maps of the macula region. This study aims to apply a density function-based statistical framework to the thickness data obtained through OCT, and to compare the predictive power of various retinal layers to assess the severity of DR. We used a prototype data set of 107 subjects which are comprised of 38 non-proliferative DR (NPDR), 28 without DR (NoDR), and 41 controls. Based on the thickness profiles, we constructed novel features which capture the variation in the distribution of the pixel-wise retinal layer thicknesses from OCT. We quantified the predictive power of each of the retinal layers to distinguish between all three pairwise comparisons of the severity in DR (NoDR vs NPDR, controls vs NPDR and controls vs NoDR). When applied to this preliminary DR data set, our density-based method demonstrated better predictive results compared with simple summary statistics. Furthermore, our results indicate considerable differences in retinal layer structuring based on the severity of DR. We found that: (a) the outer plexiform layer is the most discriminative layer for classifying NoDR vs NPDR; (b) the outer plexiform, inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers are the strongest biomarkers for discriminating controls from NPDR; and (c) the inner nuclear layer distinguishes best between controls and NoDR.\n","date":1599436800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599436800,"objectID":"edbab42a577f42cb34ad452952844666","permalink":"https://shariq-mohammed.github.io/publication/mohammed2020density/","publishdate":"2020-09-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mohammed2020density/","section":"publication","summary":"Scientific Reports (2020).\nAbstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a severe retinal disorder that can lead to vision loss, however, its underlying mechanism has not been fully understood.

The lockdown was first extended to May 3 soon after the analysis of this paper was completed, and then to May 18 while this paper was being revised. In this paper, we use a Bayesian extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (eSIR) model designed for intervention forecasting to study the short- and long-term impact of an initial 21-day lockdown on the total number of COVID-19 infections in India compared to other less severe non-pharmaceutical interventions. We compare effects of hypothetical durations of lockdown on reducing the number of active and new infections. We find that the lockdown, if implemented correctly, can reduce the total number of cases in the short term, and buy India invaluable time to prepare its healthcare and disease-monitoring system. Our analysis shows we need to have some measures of suppression in place after the lockdown for increased benefit (as measured by reduction in the number of cases). A longer lockdown between 42-56 days is preferable to substantially “flatten the curve” when compared to 21-28 days of lockdown. Our models focus solely on projecting the number of COVID-19 infections and thus, inform policymakers about one aspect of this multi-faceted decision-making problem.

We demonstrate the process of cell segmentation and feature extraction from the 2D images.\nMethods and Materials: We describe an approach to address the problem using mixture discriminant analysis (MDA) on the 2D image profiles of the RBCs. The extracted features are used with Gaussian MDA to distinguish between healthy and malaria infected cells. We also use the neutral zone classifiers where ambiguous cases are identified separately by the classifier.\nResults: We compare the classification results from the regular classifiers such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) or MDA and the methods where neutral zone classifiers are used. We see that including the neutral zone improves the classification results by controlling the false positive and false negatives. The number of misclassifications are seen to be lower than the case without neutral zone classifiers.\nConclusion: This paper presents an alternative approach for classification by incorporating neutral zone classifier approach, where a prediction is not made for the ambiguous cases. From the data analysis we see that this approach based on neutral zone classifiers presents a useful alternative in classification problems for various applications.\n","date":1560211200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560211200,"objectID":"b98ed9b4a73fc04d4236fdb6ef339358","permalink":"https://shariq-mohammed.github.io/publication/mohammed2019assessing/","publishdate":"2019-06-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mohammed2019assessing/","section":"publication","summary":"Journal of Biostatistics and Epidemiology (2019).\nAbstract: Background and Aim: We aim to build a classifier to distinguish between malaria-infected red blood cells (RBCs) and healthy cells using the two-dimensional (2D) microscopic images of RBCs. We demonstrate the process of cell segmentation and feature extraction from the 2D images.\nMethods and Materials: We describe an approach to address the problem using mixture discriminant analysis (MDA) on the 2D image profiles of the RBCs.","tags":["Journal Articles"],"title":"Assessing malaria using neutral zone classifiers with mixture discriminant analysis on 2D images of red blood cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This workshop was conducted by the Statistical Consulting Services in the Department of Statistics at the University of Connecticut in April 2018.\n","date":1524009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524009600,"objectID":"391c10d5947787dc55a6f9892fe8ec1a","permalink":"https://shariq-mohammed.github.io/teaching/uconnrshiny/","publishdate":"2018-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/uconnrshiny/","section":"teaching","summary":"Statistical Consulting Services at University of Connecticut - April 2018","tags":["Workshops"],"title":"Data Visualization with R Shiny","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"61c80758b618801a57e0e6fb7f927f47","permalink":"https://shariq-mohammed.github.io/teaching/stat3025-fall/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/stat3025-fall/","section":"teaching","summary":"Department of Statistics at University of Connecticut - Fall 2017","tags":["Courses"],"title":"STAT 3025 - Statistical Methods (Calculus Level II)","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496275200,"objectID":"328e4d0fb83417ebbdbf7b448b87b255","permalink":"https://shariq-mohammed.github.io/teaching/stat3025-summer/","publishdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/stat3025-summer/","section":"teaching","summary":"Department of Statistics at University of Connecticut - Summer 2017","tags":["Courses"],"title":"STAT 3025 - Statistical Methods (Calculus Level II)","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Introduction to Statistics I \u0026amp; II - Department of Statistics, University of Connecticut Introduction to Mathematical Statistics I \u0026amp; II - Department of Statistics, University of Connecticut Numerical Linear Algebra - Chennai Mathematical Institute Probability Theory - Chennai Mathematical Institute  ","date":1464566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464566400,"objectID":"580be5f20233d55d7155b8a16716fae4","permalink":"https://shariq-mohammed.github.io/teaching/ta/","publishdate":"2016-05-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/ta/","section":"teaching","summary":"Department of Statistics at University of Connecticut","tags":["Teaching Assistant"],"title":"Teaching Assistant","type":"teaching"},{"authors":["Sanjay P.
