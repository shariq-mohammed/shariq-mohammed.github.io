Any set of measurements taken at multiple time points for multiple subjects leads to data of more than two dimensions (a matrix of covariates for each subject). We present a Bayesian variable‐selection method to identify the active regions in the brain as a response to a certain stimulus. We build binary classification models of subject level responses by using binary regression with Gaussian models on the latent variables. We also study the scaled normal priors on the latent variables, as they cover a large family of distributions. We use continuous spike‐and‐slab priors to incorporate variable selection within the modelling. Because of the computational complexity, we build many local (at different time points) models and make predictions by utilizing the temporal structure between the local models. We perform two‐stage variable selection for each of these local models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such modelling through the results of a simulation study. We then present the performance of these models on multisubject neuroimaging (electroencephalography) data to study the effects on the functional states of the frontal cortex and parietal lobe for chronic exposure of alcohol.\n","date":1564099200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564099200,"objectID":"63309fe7b5c023135f05bc28fe99f8b3","permalink":"/publication/mohammed2019bayesian/","publishdate":"2019-07-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mohammed2019bayesian/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Because of the immense technological advances, very often we encounter data in high dimensions.

We demonstrate the process of cell segmentation and feature extraction from the 2D images.\nMethods and Materials: We describe an approach to address the problem using mixture discriminant analysis (MDA) on the 2D image profiles of the RBCs. The extracted features are used with Gaussian MDA to distinguish between healthy and malaria infected cells. We also use the neutral zone classifiers where ambiguous cases are identified separately by the classifier.\nResults: We compare the classification results from the regular classifiers such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) or MDA and the methods where neutral zone classifiers are used. We see that including the neutral zone improves the classification results by controlling the false positive and false negatives. The number of misclassifications are seen to be lower than the case without neutral zone classifiers.\nConclusion: This paper presents an alternative approach for classification by incorporating neutral zone classifier approach, where a prediction is not made for the ambiguous cases. From the data analysis we see that this approach based on neutral zone classifiers presents a useful alternative in classification problems for various applications.\n","date":1560211200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560211200,"objectID":"b98ed9b4a73fc04d4236fdb6ef339358","permalink":"/publication/mohammed2019assessing/","publishdate":"2019-06-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mohammed2019assessing/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Background and Aim: We aim to build a classifier to distinguish between malaria-infected red blood cells (RBCs) and healthy cells using the two-dimensional (2D) microscopic images of RBCs.
